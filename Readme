The global  variables are created first before the main method([String) is declared.

If those global variables have any initialized values they are assigned after the main method is declared in
the program nodes code generation phase.

Declnodes code generation takes care of the declaration and initialization of local variables.


Each expression node loads a value into the stack to be used by the statements.

Integer to character type casting opcode is provided. Other type castings weren't performed. Seemed redundant in code generation
phase. As booleans and characters are by default represented as ints.

The test case 36,39,43 produced errors

The hints used in the project description were used for the most part.
